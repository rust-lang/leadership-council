# Role Description: Rust Foundation Project Director

A Project Director is one of five Rust Project members who serve on the Board of Directors[^directors] of the Rust Foundation to represent the interests of the Rust Project[^establishment]. Project Directors are elected per the [Project Director Election Process].

The Board of Directors is the governing body of the Rust Foundation, which is incorporated as a 501(c)(6) organization in the State of Delaware, United States of America. As such, the Project Director role carries with it legal responsibilities to act on behalf of and in support of the Foundation, as well as some legal liability for the Foundation's actions[^liability].

The Board of Directors sets the direction of the Rust Foundation. Among the mechanisms the Board has to do this is hiring and overseeing the Executive Director, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Foundation.

[^directors]: Please refer to [Rust Foundation Director Roles & Responsibilities] for components of the role description that apply to all Foundation Board Directors.
[^liability]: While this sounds daunting, the Foundation has insurance to protect the Directors from legal action brought against the faction. As long as Directors carry out their board duties in good faith, to the best of their abilities, and with the best interests of the Foundation in mind, they are protected by this insurance.
[^establishment]: The Project Directors specifically are established by the [Section 4.3(d)] of the Foundation's Bylaws to represent the "Individual Members" of the Foundation. Individual members are defined as those in "the governing body of the Rust project" ([Section 2.2]), currently the Leadership Council.

    By analogy, Project Directors are to the Leadership Council what Google's Platinum Member Director is to Google, in the sense that they represent the Council's (and by extension the Project's) interests in the Rust Foundation. Although it should be noted the Rust Project is distinct from member organizations of the Rust Foundation, as the Foundation exists explicitly to serve the Rust Project, but does not exist to serve its member organisations (without specific membership stipulations)

In addition to their responsibilities to the Rust Foundation, Project Directors have responsibilities within the Rust Project, primarily ensuring the Project's relationship with Rust Foundation is healthy and productive.

## Goals

- Represent the needs and interests of the Rust Project at large within the Rust Foundation board.
- Ensure communication between the Rust Project and Foundation is robust and high fidelity.

## Time Budget

- 4-8 hours per week

## Term Length

- 2 year term

## Tasks / Activities / Responsibilities

Project Directors are delegated responsibility for the Project's relationship with the Foundation, ensuring that it is well-functioning and that, primarily, the Project's needs of the Foundation, but also the Foundation's needs of the Project, are met.

As the Leadership Council has the authority to speak as the Project, it is vital that the Project Directors regularly communicate with the Leadership Council and act in accordance with what they genuinely believe to be the will of the Leadership Council and therefore of the Project. Regular communication is required between the Leadership Council and Project Directors. In the event of larger discussions related to the Foundation's efforts, the Project Directors and Leadership Council are expected to work together to establish a consistent and coherent position that the Project Directors are then entrusted to deliver to the Foundation and guide in its implementation.

By delegating this responsibility to the Project Directors, there is a clear and well-understood point of contact for the Foundation, which aligns with who the Foundation have accountability to as board members. It will still be very beneficial for Foundation to have direct communication with the Leadership Council and individual project members where appropriate.

In addition, as the group responsible for the Project's relationship with the Foundation, the Project Directors must also ensure that the Foundation's needs from the Project are being met. For example, if there are issues in the Project impeding the Foundation's engineering efforts, then the Project Directors can work with the relevant teams and the Leadership Council to resolve these.

Similarly, as the Project Directors must approve of any significant course of action taken by the Foundation in board meetings, the Project bears some responsibility for the actions of the Foundation. Therefore, the Project Directors should also be responsible for ensuring that the Project Directors decisions and the Foundation's actions are explained and communicated to the Project's membership at large.

In summary, Project Directors are..

- **..responsible for:** the Project's relationship with the Rust Foundation

  - Ensuring that the Foundation serves the needs of the Project.
  - Ensuring that the relationship between the Project and the Foundation is productive and well-functioning, and identifying and resolving any impediments to this well-functioning.
  - Ensuring that the Foundation are well-informed of the views, priorities and needs of the Project and vice-versa.
  - Working to address the needs of the Foundation within the Project (e.g. for changes in how communication happens or difficulties with an engineering effort, etc).
  - Assisting the Foundation in their communication with the Project.
  - Delivering a "Project Director Update" in board meetings (and similarly in Leadership Council meetings if requested).
  - Publishing summaries of Foundation board meetings for the Project.

  - Project Directors are expected to accurately represent the position of the Leadership Council. When required to make decisions independently of the Leadership Council, Project Directors are expected to use their best judgement as to when to make decisions, based on their understanding of the current view of the Leadership Council and on the scale/severity/relevance of the decision at hand.
  - If the Leadership Council are dissatisfied with the performance or conduct of a Project Director, that Project Director can be removed by a majority vote of the Leadership Council (per the Foundation's By-Laws, [Section 4.5]) who can then nominate and elect a replacement to serve the remainder of the term of the removed Project Director.

  - As appropriate when expertise is required that the Project Directors do not possess.

- **..expected to keep informed:** the Leadership Council and broader project membership

  - It is vital that the Leadership Council are informed of the actions of the Project Directors and of the ongoing work and priorities of the Foundation.
  - By working closely with the Foundation staff and voting in board meetings, the Project Directors can ensure that the Foundation's work aligns with the best interests of the Project, and so should communicate to the Project membership what the Foundation is doing and how it is benefits the Rust Project.

In order for the Project Directors to be successful in their role, the Leadership Council are...

- **..expected to consult:** the Project Directors
  - Project Directors are expected to be able to communicate the needs of and constraints on the Foundation as relevant to any ongoing discussions (or to find out)

- **..expected to keep informed:** the Project Directors

## Qualities of a Project Director (required skills)

- Sufficient time and energy to dedicate to the needs of the Rust Foundation and the Rust Project.
- An interest in helping with the topics of Project operations and Project governance.
- A keen sense of the needs of Rust Project, its teams, processes, and ecosystem.
- Willingness to understand and represent viewpoints they may not have personal experience with or necessarily agree with.

## Requirements and Eligibility

There are requirements and eligibility criteria Project Directors must meet.
These are set by the Rust Project, the [Foundation Bylaws], the laws of the State of Delaware, and the laws of the United States of America.

- Project directors must be members of the Rust Project in good standing.
  Among other things, this means they must not be currently under any moderation sanction.
- Project directors must disclose their name on the Foundation's IRS Form 990, which is a public document. For an example, see the [Foundation's IRS Form 990 for 2023].
- No two project directors can be employed by the same corporate member of the Foundation.
  This comes from [Section 4.3(g)] of the Foundation bylaws. See [Employment interpretation](#employment-interpretation).
- Project Directors must disclose any conflicts of interest to the Foundation.
  These disclosures are kept confidential by the Foundation and are not shared with the public.

### Employment interpretation

The definition of *employment* is deliberately left a little open to interpretation in order to apply a principle/spirit of the rules approach to situations as they arise, rather than trying to anticipate every possible scenario and potentially tie future issues up in unintended knots.

The Project and Foundation use a fairly broad definition of employment that includes contracting relationships. This is in line with Delaware corporate law, where the key element of how "employment" is defined is that an individual is engaged to carry out work or services for the company.

The purpose of the limit of seats per company on the board is to mitigate real or perceived disproportionate corporate influence. If a substantial and/or ongoing proportion of your income is received from one company, this affiliation should be disclosed, as it may (or may be seen to) tilt the board in favor of one company.

We do not have a hard and fast number for the income threshold for disclosing as a contractor. Arguments can be made for/against almost any number, and we could disappear down a rabbit hole trying to make rules that apply to every individuals' financial circumstances. We don't want to be over-the-top, and we certainly don't want to get into a "prove your income" scenario. Our hope is that candidates take a sensible, err on the side of disclosure approach, looking at their income and asking: "realistically, if I do not disclose this affiliation, but it comes out later, will the wider community interpret that as a deliberate act of concealment / a way of gaining corporate influence by stealth" etc. This is not only to protect the Foundation's reputation, it is to protect the reputation of the PDs and the companies that they act for. Transparency is an important principle of the Foundation, and we hope that anyone considering taking a prominent role governing the Foundation would want to lean in to that.

If you have contracts that include discretion or nondisclosure agreements, and those may be considered a conflict of interest, please consult with the Foundation.

Employment information is disclosed to the Leadership Council. When elected, the Foundation will ask new PDs to register their financial interests and sign a conflict of interest policy. Wherever there is a conflict of interest in a board meeting, conflicted individuals will be required to step out of that conversation. It would be noted in the minutes that an individual stepped out due to a conflict, but it is not necessary to state what that conflict is. We do not publish PDs affiliations on the website.
