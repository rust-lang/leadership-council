# Travel spending policy

The Leadership Council of the Rust Project has allocated up to $100,000 USD to be spent each year supporting Members of the Rust Project in attending Rust-related events through the awarding of Travel Grants. These grants are intended to cover travel, hotel, and event tickets for those who otherwise cannot afford to attend. This document sets out the policy for what is allowed for these grants, and the process for the approval of these applications.

We plan to continue this program as long as funds are available. An announcement will be made if this program is discontinued, or if there are significant changes to it.

> [!NOTE]
> The Foundation is providing a separate budget of $50,000 USD for travel for RustConf 2026. The application process using the form below is the same.

## Approval guidelines

The following are guidelines for approval of an application:

- Up to $2000 per person (per year) (as long as budget remains).
- You don't have an employer that can pay for you.
- You are an active member of the Rust project.
- Your travel costs are kept reasonable (i.e. fly economy class, no five star hotels, etc.).

The usual Foundation due diligence on grantees will also be required to ensure compliance with US sanctions, proper record-keeping, anti-fraud measures, etc.

### Automatic approval

In order to reduce the overhead of processing applications, the Foundation will automatically approve applications with the following guidelines:

- The applicant is a Member of the Rust Project (as defined by being on the “All At” mailing list).
- The event is considered to be legitimate. Whilst there is no definition of a “formal” Rust event, it should be one that is broadly known within the Rust Community and considered to be of value.
- The amount being sought does not exceed $2000 USD AND, if awarded, the total amount awarded to that individual including earlier travel grants, should they exist, does not exceed $2000 USD over the course of a calendar year. The amounts should seem reasonable given the applicant's place of residence and the location of the event itself.

Applications outside of these guidelines will be sent to the Leadership Council for approval.

## Process

To apply, please fill out the [Travel Support Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoba-rdMW4i4R0ui-74f7cITxFQV8Tsw9XLY9r0iex7mBVLg/viewform). You'll need to provide the event you would like to attend, and an estimation of the budget for travel and housing support. The Foundation will send you an approval email with the total amount you will be reimbursed as well as a banking information form. You have up till 30 days post event to email the receipts of your trip to the Foundation and they will reimburse the actual costs of your trip (up to the approved limit). If you have any questions please email <mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org>.

## Transparency

As with all the Foundation’s grants programs, the Foundation will have to maintain complete and accurate records of its grantees in order to report to the [IRS]. Aggregate statistics on the number of travel grants awarded, the number of recipients, and the number of events attended as a result will also be published as part of the Foundation’s annual report. The list of recipients of travel grants and the amounts received will be available on request.
